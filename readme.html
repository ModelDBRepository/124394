This is the readme for the NEURON simulation files used in 

Nevian T, Larkum ME, Polsky A, Schiller J.  Properties of basal
dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons: a direct patch-clamp recording
study.  Nat Neurosci. 2007 Feb;10(2):206-214.

The simulation code was supplied by Alon Polsky.

The simulation demonstrates initiation of a dendritic spike by current
injection from the 'dsyn' point process (double exponential
current injection source) located 45um from the soma and
backpropagation of action potential from somatic current injection.

The simulation includes a linearcircuit mechanism that simulates the
filtration imposed thin dendritic electrodes. Effects of different
levels of filtration can be examined by clicking on 'parameters'
button on the LinearCircuit[0] panel.

When run (click Init & Run), the simulation automatically(*) executes
the simulation of a dendritic spike for a constant dendritic sodium
distribution presented at figure 6 of the paper.

To run the simulation of backpropagation of action potential set the
gmax of dsyn to zero and set the amp of IClamp to 3nA.  You can do
this in the point process window which is already open.

Example run:

Auto-launch from ModelDB and press enter to start the simulation or
download and extract the archive which will create a folder of files.
Compile the mod files and start under

Linux
-----
by cd'ing to the folder and then typing nrnivmodl, and then nrngui
mosinit.hoc

Mac OS X
--------
by dragging and dropping the folder on the makenrndll icon, and then
dragging and dropping the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

mswin
-----
by running mknrndll and cd'ing to the folder, and click on make
nrnmech.dll.  Finally double click on the mosinit.hoc file in windows
explorer.

Once the simulation is started
------------------------------

Click the Init & Run button to generate the following graph similar to
the constant distribution of Na+ current in figure 6c:

changed from 36.6C to 37C and global_ra=100ohm-cm were applied as per
original readme instructions.
